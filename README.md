# Evil-Hangman

A program that cheats at the classic game Hangman.

Class HangmanMain is the driver program for the Hangman program.  It reads 
a dictionary of words to be used during the game and then plays a game with
the user.
  
This is a cheating version of hangman that delays picking a word
to keep its options open.  You can change the setting for DEBUG to see
how many options are still left on each turn and what patterns are
being generated from the guess.
